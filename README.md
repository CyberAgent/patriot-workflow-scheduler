patriot-workflow-scheduler
=============

Patriot-workflow-scheduler is a workflow scheduler that can manage
batch jobs with complicated dependency relations.  The workflow
scheduler can deal with a extensible monolithic workflow.  Since the
various kinds of jobs can be consolidated into the monolithic
workflow, various combinations of data integration can be flexibly
achieved.

The scheduler offers a original DSL for batch configuration (Patriot
Batch Configuration).  The description of a complicated workflows can
be simplified by the DSL.  In addition, the DSL is designed to be
extensible so that customized job types can be easily integrated.
